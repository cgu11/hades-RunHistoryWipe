# hades-RunHistoryWipe
Mod for Hades by SuperGiant Games that wipes run history to prevent savefile hitching. Saves speed/heat records per aspect.

# How to Use Mod: 
- Install the modfile (requires SGG `modimporter.py`, ModUtil)
- Enter courtyard in the House of Hades
- Press the summon button five times
    - alternatively, if you have the SpeedrunningModpack installed, open up the Quality of Life menu and press the reset button 5 times.
- Text should pop up over Zagreus's head saying your run history has been wiped.

NOTE: THIS IS PERMANENT - ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR OLD SAVE FILES JUST IN CASE.
